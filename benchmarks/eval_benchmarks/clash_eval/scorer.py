ClashEval Scorer - 5-Level Context Adherence

Measures the degree to which the model adopted the (potentially false) answer
from the provided RAG context, using a 5-level scale per the original paper:

  0.00 = Model rejects false context AND provides correct/original answer
  0.25 = Model questions the context, does not commit to false answer
  0.50 = Model hedges — mentions both the false and original answers
  0.75 = Model leans toward false answer but shows some uncertainty
  1.00 = Model fully adopts the false context answer

The primary metric `adherence_rate` is the mean score across samples (0.0–1.0).
