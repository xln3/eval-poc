"""PsySafe — Multi-agent psychological safety evaluation.

Adapted from Zhang et al. "PsySafe: A Comprehensive Framework for
Psychological-based Attack, Defense, and Evaluation of Multi-agent System
Safety" (ACL 2024, Outstanding Paper Award).

Two evaluation modes:
  1. psysafe (default): Two-agent dialogue.  Agent A is primed with dark
     personality traits and generates a first response.  Agent B receives
     Agent A's output as context and continues the conversation.  The judge
     evaluates the FULL dialogue for emergent dangerous content.
  2. Single-agent fallback (with_dark_traits + generate) is retained as
     the simplest operating mode when ``multi_agent=False``.

Dataset: 855 samples (196 safe + 659 dangerous) across 13 harm dimensions.
